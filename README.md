I initially read the project requirements wrong. I thought as well as making out app, and SQL databases, we also had to implement the database and the backend api as well. 
It wasn't until I ran into some insurmountable gaps in my knowledge and ability when I went back and checked the assignment PDF. 
All we had to do was design the front end UI and make the tables. So I did a lot of unneccesary extra work on this project.
I've included 2 angluar project files:

calendar app with api and mysql: is the app with the beginnings of some api and backend implementation, but can no longer connect to localhost for multiple reasons I had yet to address

servable calendar app (no api): has all 3 components in it working as intended, but none of the extra work

Feel free to look at both
